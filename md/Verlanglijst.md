# Gift wishlist
This list is an exhaustive list of things I currently would like to receive as a present.
Items that are not featured on this list may not be appreciated; present these at your own risk.
In case someone does not want to or cannot give any of the listed gifts, I would prefer not receiving a gift over receiving money or an unappreciated gift.


## Gift preferences - These are important to me
I have a strong preference for non-physical gifts and self-made gifts (with an expiration or use-by date unless explicitly asked for).
A big part of this preference comes from an aversion of throwing out gifts when in need of physical space, when the gift is broken, or when the gift is no longer of interest.
An exception is made for self-made physical gifts with a personal nature and a compact form factor (i.e. a letter, card, puzzle, CD, DVD, (collection of) computer file(s), etc.)

Further, I do not much appreciate gifts that require me to spend time doing an activity individually.
I have a hard enough time trying to balance a student life in Eindhoven and a social life in Eindhoven't.
However nice your thought is, there is a good chance I would prefer to spend your gift's required time with you.

For all of these gifts, it holds that I also appreciate receiving it partially.
I consider as a partial gift:
 - a single component of a gift that is on the list,
 - money, if and only if it is clearly attributed to a specific gift on the list, or
 - a letter, voice memo, webpage, picture, or other form of communication that promises the later gifting of something on the list or the partial version of something on the list.
Among these, I prefer receiving a promise of money in a nice(ly written) card/letter over receiving money directly.
Examples of partial gifts would be the promise of a movie ticket for when something fun hits the cinema, a promise of a financial contribution for a gift on the list (such as a concert ticket), money that you mention is clearly reserved for a specific activity/item, a promise of a nice snacc/drincc for something like a movie night later on, etc..

Once again, if my wishlist and what you want to give me don't align, I would rather receive nothing than something I don't like.
I appreciate your presence more than I could appreciate any one gift, and you listening to and understanding my wishes is a big gift to give me, too!

Thank you for taking the time to understand my gift preferences.
I appreciate it :)

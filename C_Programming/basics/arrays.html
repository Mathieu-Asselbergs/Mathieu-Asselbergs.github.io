            <h1>Grouping valus of the same data type with arrays</h1>

            <section id="intro">
                <p>
                    Whenever there is a need to store multiple related values of
                    the same data type, you can of course define all these
                    values separately. And while this most surely is a fun way
                    to spend your afternoon, it may be more useful to add a data
                    type to your arsenal that is designed specifically for this
                    task: the array.

                <p>
                    Arrays are themselves a data type, which means that you can
                    declare variables of an array type. Such a type has two
                    parts to it: the type of value that it stores and the amount
                    of values that it stores. The syntax for the corresponding
                    value of such a type is a comma-separated list of values in
                    braces. Full array declarations look like this:

                <p>
                    This declaration is very similar to that of a single value
                    and only differs in that the name of the variable is now
                    followed by the size of the array in brackets
                    <code>[]</code>. The associated values can use more
                    explanation though.
                </p><br><p>
                    To declare an array, you can use a list of values of any
                    length up to the specified length. The <code>vec1</code>
                    example shows an array in which all entries are explicitly
                    defined. In case you specify fewer values than allowed, but
                    still give a list, the remaining values are always defined
                    as <code>0</code>. This case holds for the exaples of
                    <code>vec2</code> and <code>vec3</code> above. In case no
                    value is initially given (i.e. you give no list; empty or
                    not), C does not write any values to the memory that it
                    reserves for your array. This means that the values in your
                    array are practically random. This is the case for the
                    <code>vec4</code> example, where we give no list to
                    initialize the array with.
                </p><br><p>
                    Using values of an uninitialized variable in your program
                    leads to undefined behavior. This is because you cannot make
                    any assumptions about these values. Using them in a context
                    where you expect these values to have a certain value may
                    lead to unexpected results or crashing programs.

                    <h2>Getting and setting data through indexing</h2>
                </a>

                <p>
                    Given that arrays contain multiple values, there must surely
                    be a way to select a specific element to use. And there is!
                    To select a specific value to set, change or retrieve you
                    can select the element at a specific index in the array by
                    writing the array name, followed by brackets containing the
                    index of your choice. Do note that the indices of an array
                    start at 0, not 1. Hence to refer to the first element in an
                    array, you use index 0. In the example below, we set and
                    read every value of the <code>vec1</code> example
                    individually using array indexing.

                <p>
                    A common error that comes with indexing is using indices
                    that fall outside of your array. This can be either because
                    you accidentally use a negative index or an index that is
                    outside of the defined bounds (length) of your array. Either
                    case will be accepted by the compiler as it is correct C
                    syntax. However, when you run this code, it is likely (but
                    not impossible) that the computer memory at this wrong index
                    does not belong to your program. This is another example of
                    undefined behavior. This time however, C is able to detect
                    when you access memory that does not belong to your program.
                    When it detects this, your program will crash and you will
                    see a <code>Segmentation fault</code>. An example of an
                    incorrect program that may come from not understanding that
                    indexing starts at 0 is shown here:

                    This program incorrectly assumes that the first index is 1
                    and the last index is the 6; the length of the array. The
                    resulting behavior is a loop that prints the last 5 numbers
                    in the array where the first 5 were expected and where the
                    last call to <code>printf</code> may result in a
                    segmentation fault (accessed memory that does not belong to
                    a variable in our program).

                <p>
                    So. We can make arrays. W O W! Problem is that for example
                    <code>unsigned char c1[3];</code> does not convey enough
                    information on its own to tell you that we describe a color
                    which has a value for red, green and blue, all of which are
                    expressed by an 8-bit integer. We can define different names
                    for types to help us understand what they mean in the
                    context of our program by using the <code>typedef</code>
                    keyword. We can, for instance, rename the types in the
                    program above as follows to help us understand what
                    <code>c1</code> is:

                <br>

                <p>
                    Look at that! This program is clear about what the
                    interpretation of its types should be. We exchanged
                    <code>unsigned char</code> for the clear type definition
                    <code>UInt8</code> so that it's clear we talk about
                    unsigned 8-bit integers. Moreover, we defined an
                    <code>RgbColor</code> type, which is basically just an array
                    of three unsigned 8-bit integers as the type definition
                    shows.
                </p><br><p>
                    We can now use our <code>RgbColor</code> type as we would
                    expect. Use it as the data type of a variable and give it an
                    appropriate value. In this case, it is an array of a known
                    length, so there is no length for us to specify anymore. We
                    can just provide values as we would for an array of three
                    <code>unsigned char</code> values. Indexing also works the
                    same as <code>RgbColor</code> is just a different name for
                    the same array type.

                    In the next chapter we will cover what many consider to be
                    the most difficult part of C: pointers. However, based on
                    the information given in this explanation of arrays, I
                    believe that the concept of a pointer doesn't have to be
                    difficult to understand. In fact, let me illustrate the
                    <i>idea</i> of a pointer in code you already understand.
                    Please note that the notation I use here is not the notation
                    of pointers. These will be explained in the next lesson. I
                    express the idea of a pointer in terms of things you already
                    understand. Pay attention! This will be interesting.

                    "Mathieu, what the fucc?! How am I supposed to understand
                    <i>this</i> crap??"
                </p><br><p>
                    Excellent question!
                </p><br><p>
                    Let me start by saying that a pointer stores a memory
                    address, which you can think of as an index in the array
                    that is your computer's memory. In the first part of this
                    example, I represent storing a string (fancy name for an
                    array of <code>char</code>s) that contains my name. When I
                    do this in C, 10 bytes are allocated in memory to store that
                    string. In this case I 'allocated' 10 bytes in my 1024 byte
                    computer. The first of those allocated bytes turns out to be
                    the 415th byte in my computer's memory. This 415, the byte
                    at which my string's allocated memory begins, is called the
                    address of my string. All bytes in the string have their own
                    address. For example, you can imagine the substring
                    <code>char justTs[8];</code> to be a string with address 417
                    and length 8. That is, the first byte of that string would
                    be the 417th byte in memory (where the 't's start in the
                    original string).
                </p><br><p>
                    It is also important to know how larger data types are
                    represented. An integer, for example, may need 4 bytes
                    (which you can see by printing <code>sizeof(int)</code>) to
                    express its value. When I allocate an integer, these 4 bytes
                    are allocated for it and they all get to hold a part of the
                    full value. All these parts technically have their own
                    address. You can use all these addresses, but it makes
                    little sense to use an address that points to the middle of
                    an integer.

                    I understand that this may still be a complex concept to
                    wrap your head around. Especially if this is the first time
                    you encounter pointers. You will understand them better and
                    better the more you read or hear about them and the more you
                    use them yourself. You can also read this page another 17
                    times and still not get it. Give it time. You'll understand
                    them eventually.

                    With this newfound knowledge of arrays, it finally becomes
                    feasible to store related values in a more elegant manner
                    than in individual <code>c1</code>, <code>c2</code>,
                    <code>c3</code>, ... variables. These arrays can give an
                    introduction to the concepts of pointers and in the next
                    lesson, I will show you just how closely these two topics
                    are truly related. Lastly, with an understanding of
                    <code>typedef</code>, reality can be whatever you want. You
                    are starting to understand more and more advanced aspects of
                    C. The dark arts welcome you.

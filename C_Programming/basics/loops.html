                    All forms of loops use conditions in some way or another. If
                    you are unfamiliar with conditions or would like to know
                    more before you learn about loops, consider reading about
                    them on
                    <a href="https://fine.mtmas.nl/C_Programming/basics/if" style="color: var(--text-color)">this</a>

                    Let's consider you work at NASA, or the ESA, or Spacex, and
                    your supervisor gave you the most important task of them
                    all: developing the countdown mechanism for the launch of
                    their newest spaceship. And now let's consider that you, for
                    some reason, do not feel like writing 600
                    <code>printf</code> calls for the ten minute timer. Let's
                    consider you'd rather use loops...

                    <h2><code>for</code>-loops: knowing when to stop</h2>
                </a>

                <p>
                    There are two main types of loops in C, the first of which
                    is useful when you know exactly how often you want to repeat
                    your code: the <code>for</code>-loop. Let me walk you
                    through how such a loop is constructed.
                </p>

                <br>
    
                <div class="codecell" oncontextmenu="copyCode(this); return false;">
                    <h3>Copied!</h3>
    
                    <pre class="cellContents"><span class="invis-code">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    </span>for (int i = 5; i &gt; 0; i--) {
<span class="invis-code">    </span>    printf("Just %d more minutes before launch!\n", i);
<span class="invis-code">    </span>}<span class="invis-code">
}</span></pre>
                </div>

                <br>

                <p>
                    Much like with <code>if</code>-statements we have a keyword,
                    followed by something in parentheses and then a code block.
                    This time around, the stuff in parentheses is actually three
                    things:
                </p>

                <ul style="list-style: none;">
                    <li>
                        <code>int i = 5</code><br><p>
                            Every loop can run based on loop-specific variables.
                            In this case we make a variable <code>i</code> with
                            the value at which we start our countdown. In case
                            you do not need any loop-specific variables, you can
                            choose not to write anything here. The semicolon
                            after this part is still necessary though.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <code>i > 0</code><br><p>
                            Loops should end. And this second term in
                            parentheses makes sure they do. This second part is
                            a condition that is checked every time before the
                            loop's code block is executed. This condition can
                            contain the loop's specific variable and outside
                            variables. This field can also be left empty. Doing
                            so substitutes 1 as condition, which is always true.
                            The semicolon after this part is necessary.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <code>i--</code><br><p>
                            This update is run every time the loop's code block
                            has been fully executed. This can be useful to
                            update (loop-specific) variables and eventually end
                            the loop. In this specific case, <code>i</code> is
                            decremented by 1 after running through the loop
                            once. This updates loop-specific variable
                            <code>i</code> to count down until its value is low
                            enough to no longer meet the condition of the loop.
                            In case this part is left empty, nothing will happen
                            after the loop's code block is done executing.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <br>

                <p>
                    Although this type of loop is common, you can substitute any
                    kind of variable definition, loop condition and update in a
                    for loop. You may, for example, write a program to flex on
                    you by printing half the alphabet backwards even though you
                    can't:
                </p>

                <br>
    
                <div class="codecell" oncontextmenu="copyCode(this); return false;">
                    <h3>Copied!</h3>
    
                    <pre class="cellContents"><span class="invis-code">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    </span>for (char letter = 'z'; letter != 'm'; letter--) {
<span class="invis-code">    </span>    printf("%c", letter);
<span class="invis-code">    </span>}
<span class="invis-code">    </span>
<span class="invis-code">    </span>printf("\n");<span class="invis-code">
}</span></pre>
                </div>

                <br>

                <p>
                    Here, you may think that the loop would print the alphabet
                    backwards and skip the <code>'m'</code>. However, the loop
                    stops its execution entirely whenever its condition is
                    violated.
                    <br>
                    Crazier loops are imaginable and definitely possible!
                    However, they all follow this general shape.

                    <h2>Just a dumber <code>for</code>-loop: the <code>while</code>-loop</h2>
                </a>

                <p>
                    With a detailed understanding of <code>for</code>-loops in
                    place, <code>while</code>-loops (and
                    <code>do/while</code>-loops much the same) are incredibly
                    simple. These loops are just <code>for</code>-loops for
                    which you only specify a condition and no variables or
                    updates.
                    <br>
                    You can also think of it as an <code>if</code>-statement
                    that loops back to itself when its done executing its code.
                    In writing, these two are much alike as well: a keyword,
                    a condition in parentheses and a code block after those
                    parentheses:
                </p>

int main() {

<span class="invis-code">    </span>scanf(" %d", &init);

<span class="invis-code">    </span>while (init &gt; 0) {
<span class="invis-code">    </span>    printf("Launching in %d seconds!\n", init);

<span class="invis-code">    </span>}<span class="invis-code">

                </div>

                <br>

                <p>
                    This example shows the syntax (how to write) of a
                    <code>while</code>-loop, as well as its main strength.
                    <code>while</code>-loops do not run for a fixed number of
                    times like <code>for</code>-loops do. This gives flexibility
                    that a <code>for</code>-loop cannot. In this example, we can
                    take any initial countdown value as input and have a working
                    countdown. This makes a far more tolerant and adaptive
                    program than the one before.
                </p><br><p>
                    The last important thing about regular
                    <code>while</code>-loops is that they check their
                    condition <i>before</i> running the code block.
                    <br>
                    There exists a cousin, the <code>do/while</code>-loop that
                    instead checks the condition <i>after</i> executing the code
                    block. This means that the code in this loop's code block is
                    executed at least once as no condition is checked before the
                    first iteration of the loop. Its syntax is as follows:
                </p>

                <br>
    
                <div class="codecell" oncontextmenu="copyCode(this); return false;">

        init -= 1;

                <p>
                    Pay attention to what keywords are in use where and the fact
                    that there is a semicolon after the loop's condition.
                </p>

                    <h2>Manipulating loop behavior with <code>continue</code> and <code>break</code></h2>
                </a>

                <p>
                    One final point about loops is that you can influence how
                    they run with the <code>continue</code> and
                    <code>break</code> keywords.
                </p>

                <ul style="list-style: none;">
                    <li>
                        <code>continue</code><br><p>
                            Whenever this keyword is called, the current
                            execution of the loop's code block is ended.
                            Execution is moved to the very end of the code
                            block, meaning that for <code>while</code> and
                            <code>do/while</code>-loops the condition is
                            immediately checked. For <code>for</code>-loops,
                            this means the update is immediately executed and
                            the condition is checked. If the checked condition
                            is satisfied, the loop starts a new execution of its
                            code block.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <code>break</code><br><p>
                            Much like <code>continue</code>, this keyword stops
                            the execution of the loop's code block. However, in
                            this case this also means that the loop is done
                            looping. Regardless of whether the loop condition is
                            still met or not, <code>break</code> ends any loop.

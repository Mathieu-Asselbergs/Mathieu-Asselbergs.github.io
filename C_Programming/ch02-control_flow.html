                    Alright! Knowing how to scan, store and print information is
                    of course thrilling, but it's time to put even more power in
                    your hands. It's time to take a look at control flow.
                </p><br><p>
                    I'll write a program from scratch, and I'll explain the new
                    control flow concepts as I go. The goal today is to make a
                    program that shows the information in a part of computer
                    memory.
                </p><br><p>
                    We will reserve 5 integers worth of memory and ask the user
                    what byte in memory will be the first of all the bytes we
                    store. (This program does not truly store the integers at
                    the given byte location in memory. We make it look like it
                    does.) Luckily, we already know exactly how to do that:

                <p>
                    This may be a little weird to read for now, but it does not
                    contain any concepts you have not seen before. This program
                    does exactly what it's designed to do, but it accepts
                    negative inputs. As computers do not have negative byte
                    addresses, we should not accept negative inputs. Let's
                    make an error with an <code>if</code>-statement to fix that
                    problem!

                <p>
                    Problem solved! This <code>if</code>-statement checks if our
                    <code>firstByte</code> variable is smaller than or equal to
                    -1, and it throws an error if that condition holds true. We
                    could also have stated this condition as
                    <code>firstByte < 0</code> where we use a strict inequality.
                    And <code>-1 >= firstByte</code> - or "-1 is greater than or
                    equal to <code>firstByte</code>" - would have worked too.
                </p><br><p>
                    If the condition in the parentheses of the
                    <code>if</code>-statement is <i>not</i> met, a next check is
                    performed. This check is the check for equality between 0
                    and <code>firstByte</code>. Note that for evaluating
                    equality we use two equals-signs, not one. This is so that
                    we can distinguish between assigning to a variable and
                    checking equality. To check for inequality, we use
                    <code>!=</code> in place of <code>==</code>.
                </p><br><p>
                    There can be as many <code>else if</code>s after the
                    <code>if</code> as you may want. These will all be evaluated
                    in the order they are defined. The first condition that is
                    met, has its code executed. After the condition for an
                    <code>if</code> or <code>else if</code> is met, the
                    conditions after that are not tested and their code will not
                    be executed. In this case, just the <code>if</code> and a
                    single <code>else if</code> suffice, so that's all we use.
                </p><br><p>
                    If none of the <code>if</code> and <code>else if</code>
                    conditions are met, we execute the code in the
                    <code>else</code>-block. An <code>if</code>-statement does
                    not need to have an <code>else</code>-block, nor does it
                    need to have <code>else if</code> statements. Having just
                    the <code>if</code> is sufficient.
                </p><br><p>
                    Now, let's not shut down the program when we get a bad input.
                    Let's instead ask for another value by wrapping the asking
                    for a value in a loop.

                <p>
                    Oooh! A loop. How fancy! Now... what does it do?
                    <br>
                    Great question! Let me begin at the end and work my way to
                    the top of the code we just wrote; what is that thing to the
                    right of <code>while</code>?
                    <br>
                    That is a condition, just like we saw in the <code>if</code>
                    and <code>else if</code>-statements before. This one just
                    looks more difficult because of the fact that we use the
                    inclusive OR operator (<code>||</code>) to check two
                    conditions at the same time. Using this OR means the
                    condition for the loop is true if its first condition is
                    met <i>OR</i> if its second condition is met or if both
                    conditions are met. There is no reason to make conditions in
                    more difficult in loops than in <code>if</code>-statements.
                    This just worked to introduce the OR operator to you. There
                    is also an AND operator (<code>&&</code>) which makes a
                    condition true if the first condition is met <i>AND</i> the
                    second condition is met.
                </p><br><p>
                    <code>while</code> and <code>do/while</code> loops keep
                    looping as long as theor condition is met. In this case, if
                    0 is greater than <code>firstByte</code> <i>OR</i> if
                    <code>firstByte</code> is equal to zero, the loop continues.
                </p><br><p>
                    Speaking of <code>continue</code>ing. I have added new lines
                    to the <code>if</code>-tree we made before. The
                    <code>continue</code> I added immediately jumps to checking
                    the condition for the next run of the loop. If we reach a
                    <code>continue</code> (by entering a negative number for
                    example) we will immediately check the condition for the
                    loop and since it's met, we will start from the top right
                    away.
                </p><br><p>
                    <code>break</code> does not care about the condition of the
                    loop and breaks the loop regardless of whether its condition
                    is no longer met. In this example we break the loop of
                    searching for a non-negative and non-zero value when we find
                    one.
                </p><br><p>
                    To finish, I note the <code>do</code> at the start of the
                    loop. A <code>do/while</code> like the one we use here,
                    checks its condition at the <i>end</i> of a loop cycle. This
                    means that the code in the loop will run at least once,
                    regardless of whether its condition is met at the start of
                    the loop. A <code>while</code> loop checks its condition at
                    the beginning of a loop cycle. That means that the loop will
                    not even start if the condition is not met when you reach
                    the loop. <code>while</code> loops are written like
                    <code>while (...) { ... }</code>.

### Notes
- The academic advisors for Embedded Systems (ES) say that the master final project (MFP) for a double master degree should be 15 credits larger than the largest for the two component masters, and that the preparation phase for ES should **not** be considered here. This leads to 45 EC for the MFP for Systems and Control (SC) and 30 EC for the MFP for ES, so 45 + 15 = 60 EC for the combined MFP, **plus** the 10 credits ES MFP preparation phase. The academic advisors for SC disagree and say that a 9 EC preparation phase is included in their 45 EC. ES told me to include the prep phase in the planning for ES and leave it out of the planning for SC. I do not know if I will need to make these hours at all, or if they are included in the MFP.
- The course bucket does not include the internship for SC, the preparation phase for ES and the MFP. The total EC count would be $courses + internship + prep + MFP = (22.5 + 30 + 30 + 30) + 15 + 10 + 60 = 197.5 [EC]$.
